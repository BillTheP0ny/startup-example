Something I learned from this assigment is not to fear github. I always avoided github at all costs because it seemed really time consuming and confusing. After doing this I now know that github is a wonderful tool that is more useful than it is scary.

in VI editor if esc don't work another way is to press Ctrl + c or ctrl + z command to exit the vi editor forcefully. press ZZ (shift+z+z). it will save and exit. Ctrl + [ will also work like escape key.

Something I learned was thatwhen you do git add . there has to be a space between add and . I completly forget and wasted alot of time trying to figure out what was rong. I also learned that I can deploy straight to my website through my devopment enviroment which was really cool.

Something great that I learned from this CSS simon project was that bootstrap can be implemented into actual programs like visual studio code 3. I never knew thhat bootstrap was so extremly useful. It made the simon project look so much better! I was also suprised by how I didn't have to change a ton to get it to work!


From this startup application I learned so much! I never quite knew how to format HTML and CSS together. I mena we had done examples , but I had never done it all on my own and you learn so much when you do it all on your own. I learned how to format text, pictures and input fields in a organized manner. One of the harder things I encountered was adding both a header and footer with a bakcground color. This took me along time to get working, but it was very satisfying when it finally worked. I also learned that the deploy files isn't a command it is a class that needs to be called from terminal.
