Something I learned from this assigment is not to fear github. I always avoided github at all costs because it seemed really time consuming and confusing. After doing this I now know that github is a wonderful tool that is more useful than it is scary.

in VI editor if esc don't work another way is to press Ctrl + c or ctrl + z command to exit the vi editor forcefully. press ZZ (shift+z+z). it will save and exit. Ctrl + [ will also work like escape key.

./deployWebsite.sh -k ~/documents/jangofett.pem -h webcoding260frodobaggins.click

Something I learned was thatwhen you do git add . there has to be a space between add and . I completly forget and wasted alot of time trying to figure out what was rong. I also learned that I can deploy straight to my website through my devopment enviroment which was really cool.

./deployFiles.sh -k /Users/bilboswaggins/documents/jangofett.pem -h simon.webcoding260frodobaggins.click -s simon

Something great that I learned from this CSS simon project was that bootstrap can be implemented into actual programs like visual studio code 3. I never knew thhat bootstrap was so extremly useful. It made the simon project look so much better! I was also suprised by how I didn't have to change a ton to get it to work!


From this startup application I learned so much! I never quite knew how to format HTML and CSS together. I mena we had done examples , but I had never done it all on my own and you learn so much when you do it all on your own. I learned how to format text, pictures and input fields in a organized manner. One of the harder things I encountered was adding both a header and footer with a bakcground color. This took me along time to get working, but it was very satisfying when it finally worked. I also learned that the deploy files isn't a command it is a class that needs to be called from terminal. 

./deployFiles.sh -k /Users/bilboswaggins/documents/jangofett.pem -h simon.webcoding260frodobaggins.click -s startup



I learned alot in my simon javascript assingment. One of the most important things I learned was how to connect Javascript to CSS and HTML. I know we had learned about it and tried it a little, but this was alot more practice which gave me a great foundation for my start up project. I found the login.js javascripit file to be especially intersting becuase loggin in a user seems complicated, but it was done in three lines of code and was very simple to understand. I also thought it was fun to change the sound of the beeps for the simon machine. I thought it was really cool how the beeps were controlled by a number. It makes sense I just never thought of it.
