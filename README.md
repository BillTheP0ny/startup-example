Something I learned from this assigment is not to fear github. I always avoided github at all costs because it seemed really time consuming and confusing. After doing this I now know that github is a wonderful tool that is more useful than it is scary.

in VI editor if esc don't work another way is to press Ctrl + c or ctrl + z command to exit the vi editor forcefully. press ZZ (shift+z+z). it will save and exit. Ctrl + [ will also work like escape key.

in folter website

Something I learned was thatwhen you do git add . there has to be a space between add and . I completly forget and wasted alot of time trying to figure out what was rong. I also learned that I can deploy straight to my website through my devopment enviroment which was really cool.

./deployFiles.sh -k /Users/bilboswaggins/documents/jangofett.pem -h simon.webcoding260frodobaggins.click -s simon

Something great that I learned from this CSS simon project was that bootstrap can be implemented into actual programs like visual studio code 3. I never knew thhat bootstrap was so extremly useful. It made the simon project look so much better! I was also suprised by how I didn't have to change a ton to get it to work!


From this startup application I learned so much! I never quite knew how to format HTML and CSS together. I mena we had done examples , but I had never done it all on my own and you learn so much when you do it all on your own. I learned how to format text, pictures and input fields in a organized manner. One of the harder things I encountered was adding both a header and footer with a bakcground color. This took me along time to get working, but it was very satisfying when it finally worked. I also learned that the deploy files isn't a command it is a class that needs to be called from terminal. 

./deployFiles.sh -k /Users/bilboswaggins/documents/jangofett.pem -h simon.webcoding260frodobaggins.click -s startup



I learned alot in my simon javascript assingment. One of the most important things I learned was how to connect Javascript to CSS and HTML. I know we had learned about it and tried it a little, but this was alot more practice which gave me a great foundation for my start up project. I found the login.js javascripit file to be especially intersting becuase loggin in a user seems complicated, but it was done in three lines of code and was very simple to understand. I also thought it was fun to change the sound of the beeps for the simon machine. I thought it was really cool how the beeps were controlled by a number. It makes sense I just never thought of it.

Javascript- Startup:
Something really cool I learned from this Startup javascript project was how to get a button to create a pop up. I had an incredibly hard time getting this to work. The first mistake I made was forgetting to link my java page to my html page. I also forgot some of the javaimports I was supposed to import which led to a good amount of unnessicary debuggging. I also learned how to transition pictures from one to another on the swip of a button. I also had to do more debuggin than usual becuase my program included javascript this time. Something else I learned was that certin javascript elements such as fade in/out need css. I thought CSS was just optional for a better look, but it is actually much more useful than I knew. This project was alot of fun, but also alot of work I now feel quite confident in my abilites to create a basic website. I had also a hard time with the footer becuase it kept linking with the purchase button, but with the TAS help i learned that I didnt have it in the correct class and was missing some div closing tages.

Simon Service application- I learned alot of really cool things from this simon server project. One of the coolest things I thought was the json file. Its crazy how much code is needed in there to make the application work. When we were doing our smaller projects like node or express I  did not realize that it could turn into a massive project like package-lock.json. I thinks its really cool how thepackage lock json locks the dependencys with the installed version. Its  a great idea to lock the packages becuase the different versions can cause various errors which i never coonsidered. I know that the package lock json is randomly generated but its still really cool. I liked the package.json better becuase it made mre sense and felt more managable after reading thorugh the package lock. I think its cool how you use the different URL tags to access diferent areas of the github.

Simon DB: I learned many great things from this assignment. One very important thing I learned was that one little syntax error can cause alot of pain. I had one little typo and it cost me so much time. Next time I know that I need to double check my connection information. I thouoght it was really ,cool how in the simon project how I could do the connection and DB stuff in visual studio. For some reason i got really connfused and thought I had to do it in terminal like I did for the previous assignment, but I went to the TA lab and they helped me better understand. I also had the issue where after i DEPLOYED my website it was getting an 505 HTTP error beucse it was getting confused by the different versions of simon which I had to fix. I also struggled with changing my enviroment variables and forgot my mongo database information so I had to create a new one and link that up. Overall I found this project quite complicated but also very intersting and fullfilling. 

Simon Login: I really enjoyed this specific simon becuase for my startup I had a login made with just javascrip and it was really cool to see how I could create an actual login that can store the user and their password. My simon application would just take in the username and password and just welcome in the user based on their username not actual having any sort of login service. I also had a hard time with this simon becuase I had accidently deleted my server and dtabase and then I had to get help setting that set back up. I also thought It was to test it and see if the scores were still recoreded if I logged in on a different brower/ computer and they were. Lastly i learned and implemented a gitignore which was a great soution to having to push alll my express files. I never thought about not commiting useless files but it is very useful and saves hundreds of unessicary commits. 

Simon Websocket: Something essential I learned during this project was that I need to access my code through my terminal (non production enviroment) or my enviromental variables would not be set. I really had a hard time with this and thought that my computer had completly deleted all of my previous progress. Another thing I learned was that you needa n entire class such as peer Proxy for websockets to work. I don't know why I'd ever thought differently but I always assumed things like this were done in alterate ways, but it is very similar to how we do everything else nothing crazy different. I also thought it was cool how I had to upgrade the HTTP protocol from HTTP to websocket. It was a simple thing a few lines of code, butt quite an interseting and cool concept. I also found it intersting how we had to remove the closed connection so it wouldn't continue. In CS 240 I had to do a similar thing with the family server project. I also really liked how there was a function to kill any connections that don't respond to the ping becuase we've all been on a website that freezes up and its a bad experience. 

Simon React: I gotta say changing a normal project into a react one is alot more work than I anticipated. I thought it was really intersting that in populating App.jsx we set up the ability to block a user from the scoreboared if they have not properly reigstered/ signed in. This is alot more code than I thought it would be becuase I thought a simple if statement would do, but there was a good amount of code that went into this feature. I learned that you should never judge something from your percieved view becuase I thought this part would be easy and quick when actually it had alot mroe to it than I would have thought. This often happens to me when I code I think things will be quick and they actually take along time and I don't allocate enought time to porperly get the job done. Now I understand that I need to work on this behavior. I also thought that creating the router was really cool albeit difficult. I found it super cool how you could create a nav bar which takes the look of the website to a whole new level. I thought react wouldn't be super useful compared to the pther website aspects we have learned about but react is so important and is essential to every good website.

Startup Service: I learned so much from this project. It was so very difficult, but I learned so many important things. Getting the login and register to work was so hard and I had to get help multiple times. I had made the mistake of messing up my variable names and having some things named identical because I had done some copy and pasting and it was a real mess. I learned that I need to be very careful and precise about naming my variables and to make sure I double-check and change things when I copy and paste code. Setting up my mongodb database was easy, but it was very difficult because I kept setting the environment variables in my production environment but not in my development environment which caused me a lot of issues, and kept resetting my variables. I learned that it is important to not just work in visual studios, but I need to also work in my development environment or things will not work. I thought making the service was really cool because changing my project so it could run on localhost was really cool. Before I would just go live in the visual studio area but now I could actually access it through the internet via localhost. It was really cool to get this working. Websockets was intersting because it required me to create the peerProxy.js file. I thought this was going to be really difficult, but I actually just followed the Simon format closely and I got it easily working. It was cool to see it report when someone had connected, disconnected, and purchased something. Using node.js turned out to be very useful because it allowed me to run my program on localhost and check into things. I had a major issue because the node had kept uninstalling and every time I needed it I had to reinstall it. It turned out that I had installed it in zsh not bash and was using bash so I had to change over to zsh. It took a while to figure out, but it wasn't that big of an issue once I understood it. THis project was overall very difficult, but also very satisfying.

ask about storing user login info

From our frontend Javascript we can make requests to external services running anywhere in the world. This allows us to get external data, such as an inspirational quote, that we then inject into the DOM for the user to read. To make a web service request, we supply the URL of the web service to the fetch function that is built into the browser.The next step in building a full stack web application, is to create our own web service. Our web service will provide the static frontend files along with functions to handle fetch requests for things like storing data persistently, providing security, running tasks, executing application logic that you don't want your user to be able to see, and communicating with other users. The functionality provided by your web service represents the backend of your application.

Generally the functions provided by a web service are called endpoints, or sometimes APIs. You access the web service endpoints from your frontend JavaScript with the fetch function. In the picture below, the backend web service is not only providing the static files that make up the frontend, but also providing the web service endpoints that the frontend calls to do things like get a user, create a user, or get high scores.

Backend

The backend web service can also use fetch to make requests to other web services. For example, in the image below the frontend uses fetch to request the user's data from the backend web service. The backend then uses fetch to call two other web services, one to get the user's data from the database, and another one to request subway routes that are near the user's home. That data is then combined together by the backend web service and returned to the frontend for display in the browser.

Port	Protocol
20	File Transfer Protocol (FTP) for data transfer
22	Secure Shell (SSH) for connecting to remote devices
25	Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) for sending email
53	Domain Name System (DNS) for looking up IP addresses
80	Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) for web requests
110	Post Office Protocol (POP3) for retrieving email
123	Network Time Protocol (NTP) for managing time
161	Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) for managing network devices such as routers or printers
194	Internet Relay Chat (IRC) for chatting
443	HTTP Secure (HTTPS) for secure web requests

An HTTP request has this general syntax.

<verb> <url path, parameters, anchor> <version>
[<header key: value>]*
[

  <body>
]

If you list the files in directory you will notice that it has created a file named package.json. This file contains three main things: 1) Metadata about your project such as its name and the default entry JavaScript file, 2) commands that you can execute to do things like run, test, or distribute your code, and 3) packages that this project depends upon. With NPM initialized to work with your project, you can now use it to install a node package. As a simple example, we will install a package that knows how to tell jokes. This package is called give-me-a-joke. You can search for it on the NPM website, see how often it is installed, examine the source code, and learn about who created it. You install the package using npm install followed by the name of the package.With JavaScript we can write code that listens on a server port (e.g. 8080), receives HTTP requests, processes them, and then responds. We can use this to create a simple web service that we then execute using Node.js.

The following example first initializes the use of NPM and installs the package http. The http package contains the functionality for listening on server ports and manipulating HTTP requests.

In our example above we hard coded the store name to be provo. A real store endpoint would allow any store name to be provided as a parameter in the path. Express supports path parameters by prefixing the parameter name with a colon (:). Express creates a map of path parameters and populates it with the matching values found in the URL path. You then reference the parameters using the req.params object. Using this pattern you can rewrite our getStore endpoint as follows.

app.get('/store/:storeName', (req, res, next) => {
  res.send({ name: req.params.storeName });
}); if you wanted an endpoint that used the POST or DELETE HTTP verb then you just use the post or delete function on the Express app object.

100	Continue	The service is working on the request
200	Success	The requested resource was found and returned as appropriate.
201	Created	The request was successful and a new resource was created.
204	No Content	The request was successful but no resource is returned.
304	Not Modified	The cached version of the resource is still valid.
307	Permanent redirect	The resource is no longer at the requested location. The new location is specified in the response location header.
308	Temporary redirect	The resource is temporarily located at a different location. The temporary location is specified in the response location header.
400	Bad request	The request was malformed or invalid.
401	Unauthorized	The request did not provide a valid authentication token.
403	Forbidden	The provided authentication token is not authorized for the resource.
404	Not found	An unknown resource was requested.
408	Request timeout	The request takes too long.
409	Conflict	The provided resource represents an out of date version of the resource.
418	I'm a teapot	The service refuses to brew coffee in a teapot.
429	Too many requests	The client is making too many requests in too short of a time period.
500	Internal server error	The server failed to properly process the request.
503	Service unavailable	The server is temporarily down. The client should try again with an exponential back off.

The ability to make HTTP requests from JavaScript is one of the main technologies that changed the web from static content pages (Web 1.0) to one of web applications (Web 2.0) that fully interact with the user. Microsoft introduced the first API for making HTTP requests from JavaScript with the XMLHttpRequest API.

Today, the fetch API is the preferred way to make HTTP requests. The fetch function is built into the browser's JavaScript runtime. This means you can call it from JavaScript code running in a browser.

The basic usage of fetch takes a URL and returns a promise. The promise then function takes a callback function that is asynchronously called when the requested URL content is obtained. If the returned content is of type application/json you can use the json function on the response object to convert it to a JavaScript object.

The following example makes a fetch request to get and display an inspirational quote.

fetch('https://api.quotable.io/random')
  .then((response) => response.json())
  .then((jsonResponse) => {
    console.log(jsonResponse);
  });
Response

{
  content: 'Never put off till tomorrow what you can do today.',
  author: 'Thomas Jefferson',
};
To do a POST request you populate the options parameter with the HTTP method and headers.

fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify({
    title: 'test title',
    body: 'test body',
    userId: 1,
  }),
  headers: {
    'Content-type': 'application/json; charset=UTF-8',
  },
})
  .then((response) => response.json())
  .then((jsonResponse) => {
    console.log(jsonResponse);
  });
  
  Using Mongo from your code
With that all done, you should be good to use Atlas from both your development and production environments. You can test that things are working correctly with the following example.

const { MongoClient } = require('mongodb');
const config = require('./dbConfig.json');

async function main() {
  // Connect to the database cluster
  const url = `mongodb+srv://${config.userName}:${config.password}@${config.hostname}`;
  const client = new MongoClient(url);
  const db = client.db('rental');
  const collection = db.collection('house');

  // Test that you can connect to the database
  (async function testConnection() {
    await client.connect();
    await db.command({ ping: 1 });
  })().catch((ex) => {
    console.log(`Unable to connect to database with ${url} because ${ex.message}`);
    process.exit(1);
  });

  // Insert a document
  const house = {

avaScript running on a browser can initiate a websocket connection with the browser's WebSocket API. First you create a WebSocket object by specifying the port you want to communicate on.

You can then send messages with the send function, and register a callback using the onmessage function to receive messages.

const socket = new WebSocket('ws://localhost:9900');

socket.onmessage = (event) => {
  console.log('received: ', event.data);
};

socket.send('I am listening');
The server uses the ws package to create a WebSocketServer that is listening on the same port the browser is using. By specifying a port when you create the WebSocketServer you are telling the server to listen for HTTP connections on that port and to automatically upgrade them to a WebSocket connection if the request has a connection: Upgrade header.

When a connection is detected it calls the server's on connection callback. The server can then send messages with the send function, and register a callback using the on message function to receive messages.

Some common functional pieces in a web application chain include:

Code repository - Stores code in a shared, versioned, location.
Linter - Removes, or warns, of non-idiomatic code usage.
Prettier - Formats code according to a shared standard.
Transpiler - Compiles code into a different format. For example, from JSX to JavaScript.
Polyfill - Generates backward compatible code for supporting old browser versions that do not support the latest standards.
Bundler - Packages code into bundles for delivery to the browser. This enables compatibility (for example with ES6 module support), or performance (with lazy loading).
Minifier - Removes whitespace and renames variables in order to make code smaller and more efficient to deploy.
Testing - Automated tests at multiple levels to ensure correctness.
Deployment - Automated packaging and delivery of code from the development environment to the production environment.

Components
📖 Recommended reading: React.dev - Your First Component

React components allow you to modularize the functionality of your application. This allows the underlying code to directly represent the components that a user interacts with. It also enables code reuse as common application component often show up repeatedly.

The render function
One of the primary purposes of a component is to generate user interface. This is done with the components render function. Whatever is returned from the render function is inserted into the component HTML element.

As a simple example, a JSX file containing a React component element named Demo would cause React to load the Demo component, call the render function, and insert the result into the place of the Demo element.

JSX

<div>
  Component: <Demo />
</div>
Notice that Demo is not a valid HTML element. The transpiler will replace this tag with the resulting rendered HTML.

React component

function Demo() {
  const who = 'world';
  return <b>Hello {who}</b>;
}
Resulting HTML

<div>Component: <b>Hello world</b></p>
Properties
React components also allow you to pass information to them in the form of element properties. The component receives the properties in its constructor and then can display them when it renders.

JSX

<div>Component: <Demo who="Walke" /><div>
React component

function Demo(props) {
  return <b>Hello {props.who}</b>;
}
Resulting HTML

<div>Component: <b>Hello Walke</b></div>
State
In addition to properties, a component can have internal state. Component state is created by calling the React.useState hook function. The useState function returns a variable that contains the current state and a function to update the state. The following example creates a state variable called clicked and toggles the click state in the updateClicked function that gets called when the paragraph text is clicked.

const Clicker = () => {
  const [clicked, updateClicked] = React.useState(false);

  const onClicked = (e) => {
    updateClicked(!clicked);
  };

  return <p onClick={(e) => onClicked(e)}>clicked: {`${clicked}`}</p>;
};

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(<Clicker />);
You should note that you can use JSX even without a function. A simple variable representing JSX will work anyplace you would otherwise provide a component.

const hello = <div>Hello</div>;

ReactDOM.render(hello, document.getElementById('root'));
Class style components
In addition to the preferred function style components demonstrated above, React also supports class style components. However, you should note that the React team is moving away from the class style representation, and for that reason you should probably not use it. With that said, you are likely to see class style components and so you should be aware of the syntax. Below is the equivalent class style component for the Clicker component that we created above.

The major difference is that properties are loaded on the constructor and state is set using a setState function on the component object.

class Clicker extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      clicked: false,
    };
  }
  onClicked() {
    this.setState({
      clicked: !this.state.clicked,
    });
  }
  render() {
    return <p onClick={(e) => this.onClicked(e)}>clicked: {`${this.state.clicked}`}</p>;
  }
}

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(<Clicker />);
